SCDrummer
=========
This project is a wrapper to allow you to trigger a solenoid powered mechanical beater from SuperCollider and Arduino

The assumption is that your solenoid is triggered by a transistor or relay that is connected to a digital out on the Arduino board

Load the sketch drumOut onto your Arduino

Put the class DrumOut.sc in your SuperCollider class library (Platform.userExtensionDir) and recompile the library

Run this code in SuperCollider

//Make an instance, it will automatically find an arduino if one is attached

~drumBot=DrumOut.new(nil,nil)

//Add an arm (name, arduinoPin, strikeRate)

//The strikeRate is how long the solenoid is turned on before being turned off again

~drumBot.addArm(\drum1,13,0.5)

//Trigger the drum

~drumBot.strike(\drum1)
